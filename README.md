Project Overview
This project is designed to process and extract specific data types from a predefined collection of strings using regular expressions. The goal is to categorize and match common patterns such as HTML tags, email addresses, credit card numbers, URLs, and phone numbers. The script applies a set of regex patterns to each category and outputs the matches, helping to identify and verify different types of data.

Key Features:
Regex-based Data Extraction: Utilizes regular expressions to identify and extract various data formats.
Categorized Data Matching: The script categorizes data into five main types: HTML tags, email addresses, credit card numbers, URLs, and phone numbers.
Dynamic Matching: Supports different formats of data, such as multiple phone number formats, various email domains, and different credit card number formats.
Console Output: After processing, the matched data for each category is displayed in the console, making it easy to verify and examine the results.
Use Cases:
Data Validation: Quickly identify and validate structured data such as emails, URLs, and phone numbers in a given dataset.
Text Parsing: Extract relevant information from text for data processing or reporting purposes.
Web Scraping & Data Extraction: If you're working with HTML or scraping data from the web, this tool helps identify and extract HTML tags and URLs effectively.
